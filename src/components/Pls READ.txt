Expense Tracker Project Overview:

Developed an Expense Tracker application using React.
The application allows users to track their expenses, manage budgets, and view transaction history.

Local Storage Usage:

Utilized local storage to persist data such as the initial budget and transaction history.
Initial budget and transaction data are stored in the local storage of the user's browser.
Implemented logic to retrieve and update data from local storage to maintain state across browser sessions.

Context API Implementation:

Utilized the Context API for state management across components.
Created a BudgetContext to provide budget-related data to components throughout the application.
Implemented a BudgetProvider component to manage state related to initial budget and transactions.
Used useContext hook to access budget-related data in various components without prop drilling.
