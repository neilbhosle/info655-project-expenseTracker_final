                                        EXPENSE TRACKER PROJECT


Project Description:                           
An expense tracker is a tool or application designed to help individuals or businesses track their spending and manage their finances more effectively. It typically allows users to record and categorize their expenses, set budgets, view spending trends, and generate reports to gain insights into their financial habits. Expense trackers can be used for personal budgeting, managing business expenses, or tracking project costs. They are often available as mobile apps or web-based tools, offering convenience and accessibility for users to track their expenses anytime, anywhere.

Our expense tracker application allows users to set a budget, add transactions, view transaction history, reset budget details and transaction history, search transactions, view budget summary, and delete transactions.

Shortcomings:

Novelty and Strengths:
1.Category-wise Tracking: The ability to categorize transactions adds a level of detail that is not always found in other expense tracker applications.
2.Budget Setting: The feature to set an initial budget and track remaining budget after transactions is a useful tool for financial planning.
3.Delete Transaction: The option to delete transactions provides users with flexibility and control over their recorded data.
